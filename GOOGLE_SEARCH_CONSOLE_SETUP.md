# Google Search Console Setup Guide

## What is Google Search Console?

Google Search Console is a free tool that helps you monitor how your site appears in Google search results. It's ESSENTIAL for SEO and helps Google (and other search engines/LLMs) understand and index your site.

## Why You Need It

1. **SEO Performance** - See which keywords drive traffic
2. **Indexing Status** - Ensure all your pages are indexed
3. **Search Appearance** - Preview how your site looks in search
4. **Issues Detection** - Get alerts about mobile, security, or structured data issues
5. **LLM Training** - Your content gets crawled and used by AI models

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Go to Google Search Console
Visit: https://search.google.com/search-console/

### Step 2: Add Your Property
Click "Add Property" and enter: `https://xeinst.com`

### Step 3: Choose Verification Method
Google will offer several verification methods. Choose **HTML tag method** (easiest for Next.js):

1. Select "HTML tag"
2. Google will give you a meta tag that looks like:
   ```html
   <meta name="google-site-verification" content="YOUR_UNIQUE_CODE_HERE" />
   ```
3. Copy the `YOUR_UNIQUE_CODE_HERE` part (not the whole tag)

### Step 4: Add to Your Website
Open the file: `/Users/nadavbenedek/Xeinst Agency Website/app/layout.tsx`

Find line 61 where it says:
```typescript
verification: {
  google: 'your-google-verification-code',
},
```

Replace `'your-google-verification-code'` with YOUR actual code from Google.

For example, if Google gave you:
```html
<meta name="google-site-verification" content="abc123XYZ456" />
```

You would change it to:
```typescript
verification: {
  google: 'abc123XYZ456',
},
```

### Step 5: Deploy Your Changes
Since your site auto-deploys from GitHub:
1. Save the file
2. Commit the changes
3. Push to GitHub
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for Vercel to redeploy

### Step 6: Verify in Google Search Console
1. Go back to Google Search Console
2. Click "Verify"
3. Google will check for the meta tag
4. Success! ✅

## After Verification

### Submit Your Sitemap
1. In Google Search Console, go to "Sitemaps" in the left menu
2. Enter: `sitemap.xml`

### What to Monitor

**Check Weekly:**
- Impressions (how many see your site in search)
- Clicks (how many click through)
- Average position (ranking position)
- Coverage (pages indexed)

**Top Keywords to Track:**
- "real estate social media agency"
- "social media management for realtors"
- "video editing for real estate agents"
- "TikTok marketing for realtors"
- "best social media agency for real estate agents"

### Expected Timeline

- **Week 1-2**: Google starts crawling
- **Week 3-4**: First pages indexed
- **Month 2**: Regular impressions showing
- **Month 3+**: Keywords starting to rank
