## üìß Contact Form Setup

The contact form uses Resend for email delivery. To set it up:

1. Sign up for a [Resend](https://resend.com) account
2. Get your API key from the dashboard
3. Add it to your `.env.local` file
4. Configure your domain in Resend (optional, for better deliverability)

The form will work without Resend (it will log to console), but for production, email delivery is recommended.
